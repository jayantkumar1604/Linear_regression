# Linear_regression

A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the fundamentals of Linear Regression using Python. This project guides you through exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

📚 Contents
Linear_Regression.ipynb: Structured tutorial covering data import, EDA, model construction, evaluation metrics (MSE, R²), and result plotting.

requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies to run the notebook smoothly.

(Optional) data/: Directory to store datasets, if required.

🚀 Features
Data Loading
Import data from CSV (or other sources).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Statistical summaries
• Visualizations: scatter plots, correlation heatmaps

Modeling
• Build simple and multivariate linear regression models
• Use scikit‑learn’s LinearRegression

Evaluation
• Mean Squared Error (MSE)
• Coefficient of Determination (R²)

Visualization
• Regression line plots
• Residual diagnostics

Interactive Experiments
• Adjust features and observe performance changes
• Extend or generalize to other datasets

🔧 Setup
Clone the repo

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/jayantkumar1604/Linear_regression.git
cd Linear_regression
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the notebook

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Linear_Regression.ipynb
🧠 Requirements
Python ≥ 3.7

Core libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

🛠 Usage
Open the notebook in your browser.

Run each cell sequentially.

Observe outputs — visual plots and evaluation metrics.

Modify feature selections or add new data to experiment.

📈 Extend the Project
Swap in different datasets (e.g., housing prices, sales trends).

Add multiple regression, feature engineering, or cross-validation.

Experiment with regularization: Ridge, Lasso.

Compare with other regression models like Polynomial Regression.
